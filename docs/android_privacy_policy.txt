AlexCalc Android Privacy Policy
=================================

This application does not collect any sensitive user data. The application
does not request any permissions, so it should not be capable of collecting
anything sensitive (such as GPS position, microphone, contacts, etc).

This application does not transmit anything over the internet. This application
does not request the Android "INTERNET" permission, so it should not be capable
of transmitting anything over the internet, even if it tried.

The only information collected or stored by the application is:
* a history of previous user inputs, so that they can be accessed for
  convenience (e.g. if you input "1 + 2" and press enter, then you want to
  access "1 + 2" again, you can press "up")
* stored variables, including the last output (stored in variable "ans")
* recently used units, so that they can be shown in the UI for convenience
* the state of the radians/degrees, polar/rectangular format, and output format
  preferences (e.g. number of desired decimal places,
  normal/scientific/engineering notation, etc)

This data is stored in an SQLite database within the app's private data.
It is never transmitted over the internet or shared with any other
application.
