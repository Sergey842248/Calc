# Essential 
* dark mode, ability to switch in settings
* recently used units
* show selector in EditText
* make state persistent, allow clearing state in settings
* android: add licenses

# Nice to have
* make alt/inv button state reset on button pressed (but not alt/inv/maybe enter)
* convert alt/inv to toggle buttons? Would be nice to have some intuitive indicator of their state
* add formatting options: set number of decimal places, eng/sci/auto notation

# Clean up

* figure out how to store android build outputs in a separate folder (not in dropbox/git?)? The build becomes like 600 MB, with all the debug symbols and variants
